# Seshat
Seshat is modern and intuitive class diagram editor focused around abstraction.

Seeing the lack of good quality free and open-source diagram editor on the Internet, something had to be done. This is why we develop Seshat.

## Future development
Right now, I'm going to focus on getting out of the prototype stage and reduce the complexity of many non-essential features that have been added to the prototype as a test.

* Language driven diagram
* Automatic code <-> diagram translation
* UML mode
* Print & Image export

## What about the name ?
Seshat is the name of the egyptian Goddess of architecture.
