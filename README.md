# Seshat
Currently WIP and prototyping. Don't be scared by the design and comments ! (yet ;))
## Why ?
Seeing the lack of good quality free and open-source diagram editor on the Internet, something had to be done. This is why we develop Seshat.

## What is it ?
Seshat is a modern, intuitive & abstract code designer.

## What is this name ?
This name is the egyptian Goddess of architecture. It sounds good, I like mythology and it's quite fitting since class diagram editors are made for doing software architecure.
